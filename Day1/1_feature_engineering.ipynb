But what if we also wanted to take into account phrases or collection of words which occur in a sequence? N-grams help us achieve that. An N-gram is basically a collection of word tokens from a text document such that these tokens are contiguous and occur in a sequence. Bi-grams indicate n-grams of order 2 (two words), Tri-grams indicate n-grams of order 3 (three words), and so on. The Bag of N-Grams model is hence just an extension of the Bag of Words model so we can also leverage N-gram based features. The following example depicts bi-gram based features in each document feature vector.\n",

There are two types of hierarchical clustering algorithms namely, agglomerative and divisive methods. We will be using a agglomerative clustering algorithm, which is hierarchical clustering using a bottom up approach i.e. each observation or document starts in its own cluster and clusters are successively merged together using a distance metric which measures distances between data points and a linkage merge criterion.

We choose the Ward’s minimum variance method as our linkage criterion to minimize total within-cluster variance.

        "# Topic Models\n",
        "We can also use some summarization techniques to extract topic or concept based features from text documents. The idea of topic models revolves around the process of extracting key themes or concepts from a corpus of documents which are represented as topics. Each topic can be represented as a bag or collection of words/terms from the document corpus. Together, these terms signify a specific topic, theme or a concept and each topic can be easily distinguished from other topics by virtue of the semantic meaning conveyed by these terms. However often you do end up with overlapping topics based on the data. These concepts can range from simple facts and statements to opinions and outlook. Topic models are extremely useful in summarizing large corpus of text documents to extract and depict key concepts. They are also useful in extracting features from text data that capture latent patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are various techniques for topic modeling and most of them involve some form of matrix decomposition. Some techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) use matrix decomposition operations, more specifically Singular Valued Decomposition. We will be using another technique is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which uses a generative probabilistic model where each document consists of a combination of several topics and each term or word can be assigned to a specific topic. This is similar to pLSI based model (probabilistic LSI). Each latent topic contains a Dirichlet prior over them in the case of LDA.\n",
        "\n",
        "The math behind in this technique is pretty involved, so I will try to summarize it without boring you with a lot of details. I recommend readers to go through this excellent talk by Christine Doig.\n",
        "\n",
        "The black box in the above figure represents the core algorithm that makes use of the previously mentioned parameters to extract K topics from M documents. The following steps give a simplistic explanation of what happens in the algorithm behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once this runs for several iterations, we should have topic mixtures for each document and then generate the constituents of each topic from the terms that point to that topic. Frameworks like gensim or scikit-learn enable us to leverage the LDA model for generating topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the purpose of feature engineering which is the intent of this article, you need to remember that when LDA is applied on a document-term matrix (TF-IDF or Bag of Words feature matrix), it gets decomposed into two main components.\n",
        "\n",

        "# Shortcomings of traditional models:\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional (count-based) feature engineering strategies for textual data involve models belonging to a family of models popularly known as the Bag of Words model. This includes term frequencies, TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), N-grams and so on. While they are effective methods for extracting features from text, due to the inherent nature of the model being just a bag of unstructured words, we lose additional information like the semantics, structure, sequence and context around nearby words in each text document. This forms as enough motivation for us to explore more sophisticated models which can capture this information and give us features which are vector representation of words, popularly known as embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "# The need for word embeddings:\n",
        "\n",
        "While this does make some sense, why should we be motivated enough to learn and build these word embeddings? With regard to speech or image recognition systems, all the information is already present in the form of rich dense feature vectors embedded in high-dimensional datasets like audio spectrograms and image pixel intensities. However when it comes to raw text data, especially count based models like Bag of Words, we are dealing with individual words which may have their own identifiers and do not capture the semantic relationship amongst words. This leads to huge sparse word vectors for textual data and thus if we do not have enough data, we may end up getting poor models or even overfitting the data due to the curse of dimensionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "To overcome the shortcomings of losing out semantics and feature sparsity in bag of words model based features, we need to make use of Vector Space Models (VSMs) in such a way that we can embed word vectors in this continuous vector space based on semantic and contextual similarity. In fact the distributional hypothesis in the field of distributional semantics tells us that words which occur and are used in the same context, are semantically similar to one another and have similar meanings. In simple terms, ‘a word is characterized by the company it keeps’. One of the famous papers talking about these semantic word vectors and various types in detail is ‘Don’t count, predict! A systematic comparison of context-counting vs. context-predicting semantic vectors’ by Baroni et al. We won’t go into extensive depth but in short, there are two main types of methods for contextual word vectors. Count-based methods like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) which can be used to compute some statistical measures of how often words occur with their neighboring words in a corpus and then building out dense word vectors for each word from these measures. Predictive methods like Neural Network based language models try to predict words from its neighboring words looking at word sequences in the corpus and in the process it learns distributed representations giving us dense word embeddings. We will be focusing on these predictive methods in this article.\n",
